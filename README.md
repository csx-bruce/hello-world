About Me & GitHub

To start I'll write about myself in releationship to my using and learning GitHub.
Started using GitHub while working on Proservia's first Service Now implementation.
GitHub access was required for certain getting started excersice to install needed featurs.
Later I was involved in second project which was using Talend Open Studio for creating ETL jobs.
ETL jobs are Extract Transform and Load jobs for moving data between to seperate applicaition.
Talend Open Studio (aka TAL) was software tool used for writting java code need to execute the transfer of data. 
It used a visual programming environment (much like HP VEE product Visual Engineering Enviroment). to
TAL creates the necessary java code in visual manner using graphical objects and connections. 
The data transfer for this project was moving system performance and measurement data into a Grafana.
Having GitHub access was also quite helpful when getting started with Grafana to added excerise and features.
to local Grafana system for learning and testing purposes.
